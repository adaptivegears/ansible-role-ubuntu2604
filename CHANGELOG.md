# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), versions follow [CalVer](https://calver.org/) (`YYYY.M.MICRO`).

## [Unreleased]

## [2026.10.5] - 2026-10-20

### Changed
- **Kubernetes task layout**: Split the role into numbered task files with static imports. Application task order and behavior are preserved; preflight/configuration run with `always`.
- **Ubuntu task layout**: Split the role into numbered task files with explicit static imports in `tasks/main.yml`. Task order, tags, conditions, and handler behavior are unchanged.

### Breaking Changes
- **Kubernetes desired configuration**: All ten public variables retain their names in `defaults/main.yml` and reuse a full validated snapshot, including initial API address and kubeconfig owner. Legacy INI facts are automatically expanded to JSON under the existing `cluster` namespace. Immutable identity conflicts, invalid IPv4 networking, or missing users fail before writing; repeat other previous custom settings once when upgrading.
- **Ubuntu desired configuration**: Hostname is now required on first use. All seven public variables remain in `defaults/main.yml` with saved-value fallbacks. The complete validated configuration, including defaults, is persisted before application and reused on later runs. Old hostname-only facts remain readable; existing custom values for other settings should be supplied once when upgrading.
- **Required initial cluster name**: `kubernetes_cluster_name` no longer defaults to `kubernetes`. Supply a non-empty string on the first run; later runs reuse the stored cluster name automatically. An explicitly different name is rejected before mutation without overwriting the local fact. Stored cluster identity remains immutable.

## [2026.10.4] - 2026-10-20

### Added
- **Remembered hostname**: `ubuntu2604_hostname` applies and saves explicit names to `/etc/ansible/facts.d/ubuntu2604.fact`. Later runs reuse the saved value without rewriting it; hosts without an explicit or saved name are untouched. The `hostname` section also maintains local name resolution and prevents cloud-init from resetting the chosen name.

## [2026.10.3] - 2026-10-20

### Changed
- **Automatic root SSH preservation**: Running the Ubuntu role as root now forces `PermitRootLogin yes` regardless of `ubuntu2604_ssh_allow_root_login`, including an explicit `false`. Non-root provisioning still honors the variable. Password authentication remains disabled and authorized keys are still required.

### Added
- **Galaxy publishing target**: `make publish` checks the collection, builds a fresh artifact, and publishes the version declared in `galaxy.yml` using the configured Galaxy token.

## [2026.10.2] - 2026-10-20

### Added
- **Kubernetes role and playbook**: Imported the standalone single-node Kubernetes role, its testinfra verification, and documentation from `ansible-role-kubernetes`. Run `ansible-playbook andreygubarev.com.kubernetes` locally; kubeconfig defaults to the invoking user, and the Ubuntu role is not applied automatically.

### Changed
- **License**: The collection and both roles are now licensed under Apache-2.0.

## [2026.10.1] - 2026-10-20

### Breaking Changes
- **Local playbook**: The included `ubuntu2604` playbook now configures localhost using a local connection, without inventory or SSH transport. It derives the guardrail user from local facts and preserves SSH key and root-login checks. Remote provisioning uses the role in a caller-owned playbook.
- **Collection packaging**: The repository is now the `andreygubarev.com` collection. The Ubuntu role lives in `roles/ubuntu2604` and is referenced as `andreygubarev.com.ubuntu2604`. Install the published collection with `ansible-galaxy collection install andreygubarev.com` or the development checkout with `make deps`, then run `ansible-playbook andreygubarev.com.ubuntu2604` instead of the former root `playbook.yml`. Collection dependencies are declared in `galaxy.yml` instead of `requirements.yml`.
- **Source breadcrumbs**: Managed configuration files and their verification now point to `https://github.com/andreygubarev/ansible-collection`.
- **Purge installed snaps**: The role now removes all installed snap applications, dependencies, revisions, and their data with `--purge` before removing snapd, instead of refusing to continue when snaps are present. No automatic removal snapshots are created. Use `--skip-tags snap` if snaps must be retained.

## [2026.10.0] - 2026-10-20

### Highlights
This release adopts the exact ssh-audit Ubuntu 26.04 server crypto profile, regenerates image-provided SSH host keys on first configuration, and updates Ansible requirements and provisioning checks.

### Breaking Changes
- **Ansible requirement**: The minimum supported version is now ansible-core 2.20, which supports Ubuntu 26.04's Python 3.14. Control-node Python requirements are documented separately.
- **SSH crypto policy**: All nine crypto directives now match the ssh-audit Ubuntu 26.04 server guide v1 dated 2026-06-14. Clients must support hybrid post-quantum key exchange; ECDSA user keys and RSA user keys shorter than 3072 bits are no longer accepted.
- **First-run host identities**: When `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/00-ubuntu2604-hardening.conf` does not exist, existing host keys are replaced with Ed25519 and RSA 4096 keys. This changes server fingerprints. Existing role configuration prevents regeneration, including when crypto settings change.

### Improvements
- **Safe selective execution**: OS and architecture checks and the cloud-init barrier use `always`; SSH guardrails follow `ssh`; snapd guardrails and cleanup also follow `packages`. Network runs include prerequisite kernel modules, and package upgrades include reboot reporting.
- **SSH connection cleanup**: `ClientAliveCountMax` is now `3` with a 300-second interval, disconnecting unresponsive clients after approximately 15 minutes without terminating responsive idle sessions.
- **APT maintenance timers**: Both daily timers are started as well as enabled, so stopped timers do not require a reboot to become active.
- **Collection discovery**: `ansible.cfg` includes the repository-local collection directory alongside the standard user and system paths, making dependencies installed by `make deps` available to standalone Ansible commands.

### Internal
- Updated `community.general` from 13.0.0 to 13.5.0.
- SSH verification now expects the default port 22, checks all nine crypto directives, and verifies Ed25519 and RSA 4096 host keys.
- APT timer verification now checks both enabled and running state.
- Updated configuration and quickstart documentation to reflect the new requirements and behavior.

## [2026.6.1] - 2026-06-10

### Highlights
This release makes the SSH server port configurable so hosts can hand port 22 to another service (such as an application SSH endpoint) and serve OpenSSH admin access elsewhere.

### New Features
- **Configurable SSH port**: New `ubuntu2604_ssh_port` variable (default `22`) sets the `Port` directive in the hardening drop-in. Ubuntu 26.04's socket-activated sshd follows automatically because `sshd-socket-generator` derives `ssh.socket` `ListenStream` entries from `sshd_config`.

### Improvements
- **Socket-aware OpenSSH restart**: The restart handler now reloads systemd and restarts `ssh.socket` before `ssh.service` so listener changes take effect under socket activation instead of only restarting the daemon.

### Internal
- Tests verify the configured port is persistent in the drop-in, effective in `sshd -T`, and actually listening.
- The example inventory documents pairing `ansible_port` with `ubuntu2604_ssh_port` when the port moves.

## [2026.6.0] - 2026-06-09

### Highlights
This release makes the role fully provider-neutral by removing all AWS-specific integration and simplifies networking with an opt-in IPv6 disable flag. APT sources now point directly at Canonical endpoints without mirror-list indirection.

### Breaking Changes
- **Removed AWS integration**: Dropped EC2 metadata gathering, regional `ec2.archive.ubuntu.com` mirror fallback, the `ubuntu2604_cloud` variable, the `aws` task tag, and the `amazon.aws` collection dependency. AWS-specific behavior now belongs in a separate role.
- **Replaced `ubuntu2604_prefer_ipv4` with `ubuntu2604_disable_ipv6`**: The old gai.conf-based IPv4 preference and address-selection tasks are removed. The new `ubuntu2604_disable_ipv6` variable (default `true`) controls IPv6 at the sysctl level across all interfaces.
- **Removed `open-vm-tools` from package cleanup**: VMware-specific assumptions no longer apply in the provider-neutral baseline.

### Improvements
- **Provider-neutral APT sources**: The `ubuntu.sources` template now uses direct `archive.ubuntu.com` and `security.ubuntu.com` URIs instead of `mirror+file` indirection through managed mirror lists. Legacy mirror list files are cleaned up automatically.
- **Simplified APT cache logic**: Cache refresh condition no longer tracks mirror list changes, only source file changes.
- **IPv6 sysctl controls**: When IPv6 is enabled, the role explicitly configures RA acceptance and forwarding for bridge compatibility. When disabled, all interfaces including loopback are covered.
- **Container-worker terminology**: Task names, comments, and tests reframed from "VPS" to "container-worker" to better describe the role's target environment.

### Internal
- Kernel and network sysctl tasks now carry both `kernel` and `network` tags for selective execution.
- Tests updated: removed gai.conf and mirror-list assertions, added legacy mirror absence checks and direct-endpoint verification.

## [2026.5.7] - 2026-05-30

### Highlights
This release slims VPS images by removing snapd and desktop-style packages, renames the role and its variables for consistency, and adds tunable IPv4 preference for dual-stack hosts.

### New Features
- **IPv4 preference on dual-stack**: Configures `/etc/gai.conf` so IPv4 is preferred when both families are available without disabling IPv6; controlled by `ubuntu2604_prefer_ipv4` (default `true`)
- **Snapd removal with guardrails**: Removes `snapd` and residual directories when no snaps are installed, and pins the package at negative priority so it cannot be reinstalled accidentally
- **VPS image slimming**: Purges ~20 VPS-irrelevant packages including desktop helpers (`packagekit`, `polkitd`), hardware daemons (`fwupd`, `modemmanager`, `bolt`), cloud agents (`open-vm-tools`, `ubuntu-pro-client`), and interactive tooling (`apport`, `update-manager-core`, `sysstat`)

### Breaking Changes
- **Role renamed to `ubuntu2604`**: The role directory, variable prefix, and documentation references changed from `ubuntu_2604` to `ubuntu2604`. Update playbook imports, variable overrides, and any external references accordingly.

### Improvements
- **Removed `ansible.posix` dependency**: All configuration persistence now uses builtin `copy` and `command` modules, eliminating the external collection requirement
- **SSH test alignment**: Testinfra no longer hardcodes `PermitRootLogin no`; it now follows the `ubuntu2604_ssh_allow_root_login` default

### Internal
- Reverted restrictive `.envrc` setup to allow `dotenv` loading and added `.env` to `.gitignore`

## [2026.5.6] - 2026-05-30

### Highlights
This release makes SSH hardening safer and sequencing more robust by adding guardrails and a cloud-init wait barrier.

### New Features
- **SSH lockout guardrails**: Before disabling password authentication or root login, the role asserts that the Ansible user has an authorized_keys file and that root SSH remains reachable when connected as root
- **cloud-init wait barrier**: The role waits up to 30 minutes for cloud-init to complete before mutating the host, accepting completion-with-errors and warning when boot-time initialization issues remain

### Improvements
- **APT lock timeout**: Safe upgrades now wait up to 10 minutes for dpkg locks instead of failing when cloud-init or unattended upgrades hold the lock at boot

### Internal
- **Concise comments**: Rationale comments throughout tasks, ansible.cfg, and docs were tightened to reduce verbosity without losing intent
- **Role description**: Rephrased from "disposable container workers" to "container workloads"

## [2026.5.5] - 2026-05-28

### Highlights
This release adds SSH hardening, systemd manager density defaults, journald log pressure controls, nftables firewall ownership, and prerequisite assertions. APT mirror selection is safer, and more settings are exposed as user-configurable defaults.

### New Features
- **SSH hardening**: Priority drop-in (`00-ubuntu2604-hardening.conf`) pins a restricted algorithm set, disables password authentication, and limits forwarding; root login and TCP forwarding are configurable via `ubuntu2604_ssh_allow_root_login` and `ubuntu2604_ssh_allow_tcp_forwarding`
- **Systemd density defaults**: Manager drop-in sets `DefaultLimitNOFILE`, `DefaultLimitNPROC`, and `DefaultTasksMax` to `65536`, plus enables memory and task cgroup accounting so service-launched workloads inherit the same headroom as login sessions
- **Journald log pressure controls**: Persistent journals capped at 1 GB total, 128 MB per file, 30-day retention, with reserved free space on `/var/log` and `/run` so log bursts cannot crowd out packages or workload state
- **Firewall manager selection**: `nftables` is enabled as the host firewall manager, `ufw` is masked, and iptables-family compatibility commands are switched to the nft backend
- **Reboot-required reporting**: After safe upgrades, the role surfaces `/var/run/reboot-required` and the list of triggering packages without rebooting the host
- **Prerequisite assertions**: Role fails fast with a clear message when run on a non-Ubuntu 26.04 host or an unsupported architecture

### Improvements
- **APT mirror safety**: Canonical archives are now primary, with EC2 regional mirrors as fallback, avoiding stale-index sync races; arm64 hosts use the standard archive instead of `ports.ubuntu.com`
- **User-configurable defaults**: `ubuntu2604_locale`, `ubuntu2604_timezone`, and the new SSH toggles are now defined in `defaults/main.yml` instead of `vars/main.yml`
- **Expanded testinfra coverage**: New parametrized tests verify systemd manager settings, journald persistence, firewall state, SSH hardening, reboot markers, and APT mirror priorities

### Internal
- Added `ansible.cfg` with SSH connection multiplexing, pipelining, and retry tuning for faster playbook runs
- New task tags: `systemd`, `logs`, `firewall`, and `ssh`

## [2026.5.4] - 2026-05-27

### Highlights
This release adds operational troubleshooting packages, UTC time synchronization, systemd-resolved DNS fallback, and quiet MOTD handling. AWS integration now requires explicit opt-in instead of automatic platform detection.

### New Features
- **Operational packages**: Installs a standard troubleshooting toolbox (`htop`, `iotop`, `jq`, `tcpdump`, `tmux`, `bind9-dnsutils`, and others) so incident response does not start by changing package state
- **UTC timezone with chrony**: Pins the system timezone to UTC and ensures the `chrony` time synchronization service is active for predictable cross-region log correlation
- **systemd-resolved fallback DNS**: Configures `systemd-resolved` with Cloudflare fallback resolvers (`1.1.1.1`, `1.0.0.1`) that are only consulted when DHCP-supplied DNS is unavailable, preserving internal zone resolution
- **Quiet MOTD**: Removes dynamic MOTD entries, clears static `/etc/motd`, masks the `motd-news.timer`, and scrubs transient cache files for low-noise SSH logins on container workers

### Breaking Changes
- **AWS detection is now explicit**: The role no longer auto-detects EC2 via platform heuristics. Set `ubuntu2604_cloud: "aws"` to enable AWS-aware behavior such as regional APT mirror selection

### Improvements
- **Concise sysctl comments**: Rationale comments for kernel tuning settings were tightened to reduce redundancy without losing intent
- **Retained `overlay` module preload**: The role continues to force-load `overlay` so OverlayFS readiness is explicit for container runtimes that use overlay snapshotters
- **Expanded documentation**: Quickstart and configuration reference now cover task tag selectors and APT/unattended-upgrade behavior

### Internal
- New `aws` task tag for EC2 metadata gathering and regional mirror selection

## [2026.5.3] - 2026-05-26

### Highlights
This release adds deterministic APT source management with AWS regional mirror awareness, safe package upgrades, and explicit unattended security upgrade policies that block automatic reboots.

### New Features
- **AWS-aware APT mirror selection**: Detects EC2 instances via platform facts and IMDS, preferring regional `ec2.archive.ubuntu.com` mirrors with fallback to Canonical-operated endpoints; replaces cloud-init defaults with deterministic source lists
- **Safe APT upgrades**: Applies `safe` upgrades, `autoremove`, and `autoclean` during role runs so fresh VMs stay current without accepting disruptive dependency changes
- **Unattended security upgrades**: Explicitly enables periodic security updates while disabling automatic reboots, shutdown-time installs, and needrestart automatic service restarts; container workloads remain stable outside operator-controlled maintenance windows
- **Task tags**: All tasks tagged with semantic selectors (`kernel`, `swap`, `apt`, `locale`, `unattended_upgrades`, `upgrade`, `packages`) for selective execution

### Improvements
- **Expanded testinfra coverage**: New parametrized tests verify APT mirror lists, source file syntax, unattended-upgrade settings, needrestart policy, and APT maintenance timer state

### Internal
- Added `amazon.aws` collection dependency (`10.1.2`) for EC2 metadata fact gathering
- Removed unused `templates/.gitkeep` scaffolding

## [2026.5.2] - 2026-05-26

### Highlights
This release adds a comprehensive pytest-testinfra verification suite, user-facing documentation, and faster parallel test execution.

### New Features
- **Integration test suite**: `ubuntu2604/tests/test_ubuntu2604.py` verifies kernel modules, sysctl persistence, PAM limits, transparent hugepages, swap removal, and locale configuration using pytest-testinfra
- **Documentation site**: New `docs/` pages including a quickstart guide, configuration reference, and overview index

### Improvements
- **Parallel test execution**: `make test` runs testinfra checks across 8 workers with `pytest-xdist` for faster verification cycles
- **Makefile organization**: Variables renamed for clarity and separated by tool (Ansible vs. testinfra)

### Internal
- Replaced legacy Ansible role test scaffolding (`tests/test.yml`, `tests/inventory`) with the new pytest-based suite

## [2026.5.1] - 2026-05-26

### Highlights
Initial release of the `ubuntu2604` role for provisioning Ubuntu 26.04 VMs for container workloads. The role favors predictable networking, dense process scheduling, and automatic recovery over general-purpose desktop defaults.

### New Features
- **Container-optimized kernel tuning**: Loads `br_netfilter`, `nf_conntrack`, and `overlay` modules; applies 30+ sysctl parameters for bridge netfilter, IPv4/IPv6 forwarding, connection tracking, file descriptor limits, and VMA mapping
- **PAM limits**: Raises soft and hard `nofile` and `nproc` limits to 65536 so container-launched sessions can use the enlarged kernel ceilings
- **Transparent hugepages policy**: Installs a systemd one-shot service that sets THP to `madvise`, letting runtimes opt in without forcing global hugepages on latency-sensitive workloads
- **Swap disable**: Turns off active swap and scrubs swap entries from `/etc/fstab` to keep OOM behavior predictable and avoid container latency spikes
- **Locale enforcement**: Installs the `locales` package, generates a configurable UTF-8 locale, and sets it as the system default
- **Linting and dependency automation**: `Makefile` targets for `ansible-lint` and collection installation, run via `uvx` for reproducible tooling

### Internal
- Role metadata, handlers, and variable scaffolding established with production-grade `ansible-lint` configuration
