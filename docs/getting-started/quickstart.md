# Ubuntu quickstart

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 26.04 on amd64 or arm64; ansible-core ≥ 2.20.
- A compatible control-node Python version: 3.12–3.14 for ansible-core 2.20 ([support matrix](https://docs.ansible.com/projects/ansible-core/2.20/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html#ansible-core-support-matrix)).
- Root or sudo access and a non-empty `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` for the provisioning user.

## Run locally

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install andreygubarev.com --upgrade
ansible-playbook andreygubarev.com.ubuntu2604 -e ubuntu2604_hostname=worker-1
```

No inventory or SSH transport is required. Add `-K` if sudo requires a password. Hostname is mandatory on the first run. Set other overrides at the same time, such as `-e ubuntu2604_disable_ipv6=false` for IPv6/dual-stack hosts.

The complete validated configuration, including defaults, is saved before application. Subsequent runs reuse it:

```bash
ansible-playbook andreygubarev.com.ubuntu2604
```

To change a setting, supply a new override once. Invalid input does not overwrite saved settings; application failures retain the desired configuration for retry. See [persistence](../reference/configuration.md#persistence).

## Operational cautions

- Intended for fresh container-host VMs. All snaps and their data are purged without backups; use `--skip-tags snap` to retain them.
- Password SSH authentication is disabled. Root provisioning always retains root SSH access, regardless of `ubuntu2604_ssh_allow_root_login`; non-root sudo escalation does not trigger this override.
- First SSH configuration regenerates host keys. Verify new fingerprints through a trusted channel before updating `known_hosts`. See [SSH policy](../reference/configuration.md#ssh-policy) for client requirements.
- Package upgrades run by default. Reboot requirements are reported, but the role does not reboot the host.
- Cloud-init is allowed up to 30 minutes to finish; completed runs with errors produce a warning.

## Select sections

```bash
ansible-playbook andreygubarev.com.ubuntu2604 --tags hostname
ansible-playbook andreygubarev.com.ubuntu2604 --skip-tags upgrade
```

See [tags](../reference/configuration.md#tags). Configuration validation and persistence run with `always`, including selective runs; do not skip it. SSH key checks run with `ssh`.

## Remote provisioning

Use the role in your own `workers.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Configure container hosts
  hosts: workers
  roles:
    - andreygubarev.com.ubuntu2604
```

Set the SSH login user in inventory, for example `worker1 ansible_user=ubuntu ubuntu2604_hostname=worker1`, then run:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini workers.yml
```

## Integration tests

From a repository checkout on a machine with local Incus VM support:

```bash
make test
```

This creates a fresh VM, applies Ubuntu followed by Kubernetes, Terraform tooling, and agent skills, verifies all four roles, checks repeat application, and verifies persistence after reboot. It does not verify the host running the command. See [development](../../README.md#integration-tests) for requirements and failure diagnostics.
