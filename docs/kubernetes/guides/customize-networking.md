# Kubernetes networking

Choose API and cluster network addresses before initialization:

```yaml
kubernetes_cluster_name: my-cluster
kubernetes_advertise_address: 203.0.113.10
kubernetes_pod_subnet: 10.244.0.0/16
kubernetes_service_subnet: 10.96.0.0/16
```

The API address initially defaults to the host's IPv4 address, then is remembered. It controls the advertise address, endpoint, bind address, and certificate SAN; restrict access to TCP/6443. Changing an initialized cluster's address may require a separate certificate/network migration; the role does not renew certificates automatically.

The default pod CIDR matches Flannel v0.28.10. For another CIDR, set `kubernetes_flannel_manifest_url` to a manifest with a matching `net-conf.json` `Network`. The role does not rewrite the manifest or upgrade an existing Flannel installation.

## Constraints

- Cluster name, Kubernetes minor version, and both CIDRs are immutable and stored in `/etc/ansible/facts.d/kubernetes.fact`.
- All public settings are reused automatically. Explicit changes to immutable identity are rejected; version/CIDR defaults from newer role releases cannot reset existing choices.
- The API must be outside valid, non-overlapping IPv4 pod and service networks; validation precedes persistence.
- Existing clusters are not reinitialized. Back up and rebuild, or use a separate migration procedure, to change identity or CIDRs.
- Calico-to-Flannel migration is not automated. Flannel does not enforce NetworkPolicy.
